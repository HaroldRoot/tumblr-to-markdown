# Tumblr to Markdown

If you want to crawl blogs from `https://somebody.tumblr.com/`,
just write `somebody` into `config.toml`:

```toml
names = ["somebody"]
```

and run the following commands in the terminal:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

It is recommended to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to view the Markdown files generated by this program.
